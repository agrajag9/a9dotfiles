## A few thoughts on the design

* Colors taken from [doomemacs/doomemacs](doomemacs/doomemacs)
* Prompt line enables quick copy/paste with audit trail (datetime + user + hostname + pwd) or quick anonymization with copy/paste
* Also useful for moving files around
 * Double-click-and-drag by design
* I really want this to be as portable as possible, but I daily-drive FreeBSD these days so YMMV ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* Font is from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), which has the extra glyphs patched in

## Screenshots are nice, right?
