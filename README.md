## A few thoughts on the design

* Colors from [doom-one-theme.el in doomemacs/themes](https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/blob/v2.3.0/themes/doom-one-theme.el)
  * A clean example can be found at [https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)
* Double-click-and-drag by design
  * Prompt line enables quick copy/paste with audit trail (datetime + user + hostname + pwd) or quick anonymization with copy/paste
  * Also useful for moving files around
* I really want this to be as portable as possible, but I daily-drive FreeBSD these days so YMMV ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  * I even try to keep the i3 and sway configs aligned
* Font is from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), which has the extra glyphs patched in

## Screenshots are nice, right?
